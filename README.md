# tvlisp — a Lisp REPL / mini-IDE

`tvlisp` is a dedicated Lisp environment built on
[**tvision**](https://github.com/lispnik/tvision), the Common Lisp port of
Borland's Turbo Vision text-mode UI framework.  It uses an in-process,
micros-style backend (the same operation set Lem gets from micros, but built
directly on SBCL built-ins with zero external deps), so the running TUI *is* the
Lisp image being driven.

## Requirements

- **SBCL** — uses SBCL-specific introspection, threads, and `sb-introspect`.
- **ocicl** for system management, plus the
  [**tvision**](https://github.com/lispnik/tvision) framework cloned as a sibling
  project at `../tvision` (tvision is not on ocicl).  `./systems/tvision`
  symlinks to it so ASDF resolves the dependency from this project; `make` also
  adds the project tree to the source registry explicitly, so the build works
  without any global config:

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:lispnik/tvision.git   # alongside this tvlisp checkout
  ```
- The **binary has no external dependencies** (only SBCL + tvision).  Only the
  test suite pulls in [FiveAM](https://github.com/lispci/fiveam) (pinned in
  `ocicl.csv`; run `ocicl install` to restore it on a fresh checkout).

## Building & running

```sh
make            # build ./tvlisp
make run        # build and run
make test       # unit suite (88 checks) + end-to-end pty smoke test (11 checks)
make test-lisp  # just the headless unit suite (REPL/debugger/inspector/threads)
make clean      # remove the binary and this project's fasl cache

# or directly, without make (from this directory):
sbcl --eval '(asdf:make :tvlisp)' --quit     # -> ./tvlisp
# or from Lisp:  (asdf:load-system :tvlisp) (tvision-tvlisp:main)
```

`asdf:make` uses the `program-op` / `build-pathname` / `entry-point` settings in
`tvlisp.asd` to dump a self-contained binary.

### Running on the tv2 CLOS kernel

`tvlisp` is built on the original `tvision` framework.  Every tvlisp window has
also been rebuilt on **tv2**, a clean-break CLOS-native re-architecture of the
framework (reactive metaclass, CLOS event dispatch, named commands + keymaps, a
layout DSL, MOP persistence, a worker→UI bridge — see
[`../tvision/tv2/README.md`](../tvision/tv2/README.md)).  The `tvlisp/tv2` system
launches that IDE — a menu of the ported windows (REPL, editor, project manager,
browsers, thread monitor, HTML browser):

```sh
make tvlisp-tv2   # build ./tvlisp-tv2 (runs on the tv2 kernel)
make run-tv2      # build and run it
```

It is a separate system/binary, so the classic build above is untouched.  The
IDE is a Turbo-Vision-style desktop — a menu bar, a status bar, and the ported
windows (REPL with the SLDB debugger, the syntax-highlighting editor, the git
project tree, the HTML browser with find-in-page).  The demo below tours the
complete IDE: the full menu bar, paredit + line numbers in the editor, source
navigation (go-to-definition), and a live HyperSpec lookup — alongside the
tracing / stepping / profiling / inspector tools migrated earlier:

![tvlisp on the tv2 CLOS kernel](media/tv2-ide.gif)

At a glance — the tools it ships (each detailed below):

- **REPL** — threaded per-listener evaluation, **completion** (prefix +
  **fuzzy**), CL history variables, sticky package, arglist echo, persistent
  history / transcript / session, and **presentations** (double-click a printed
  result to inspect the live object).
- **Debugger** (SLIME `sldb`-style, across the worker thread) — restart menu, a
  **readable backtrace** (machinery hidden, calls with arguments, `file:line`,
  condition header, inline locals, search), and **frame ops**: return-from /
  restart / disassemble / eval-in / view-source.  **Break on entry** stops a
  function's next call here; `break`/`cerror`/`invoke-debugger` route here too.
- **Navigate** — **go-to-definition** with an **Alt-,** pop-back stack,
  **cross-reference** (who calls / references / binds / sets / macroexpands),
  and class / package / ASDF-system / function browsers.
- **Understand** — a drillable **object inspector** (back *and* forward history),
  an **interactive macro stepper** (expand any subform in place), describe /
  documentation / disassemble, a **call tree** (watch functions; live
  args/results as a navigable tree), statistical + deterministic **profilers**,
  a **thread monitor**, and HyperSpec lookup/browsing plus the SBCL, ECL, and
  CCL manuals.
- **Edit** — Lisp syntax highlighting + `cl-indent` auto-indent, **eval** and
  **compile** the defun/region (compile with **navigable compiler notes**),
  in-buffer **symbol completion**, **comment region**, **paredit** structural
  edits (wrap / splice / raise / transpose / slurp / barf both ways / kill sexp),
  **rename symbol**, **reorder args**, templates, and
  find / replace / incremental-search.

**REPL core**

- **Threaded evaluation (one worker thread per listener).** Each REPL window
  evaluates on its own `sb-thread` worker, so the UI never freezes: output
  streams into the transcript live as it is produced, multiple REPL windows run
  concurrently, and a long/infinite computation can be aborted with **Ctrl-C**
  (Edit ▸ Interrupt eval).  Set `*repl-async*` to nil to force inline evaluation.
- **Tab completion** against the current package; multiple candidates pop up in a
  list, a common prefix is filled in, and `pkg:`/`pkg::` tokens are supported.
  When nothing prefix-matches it falls back to **fuzzy (flex) completion** —
  `mvb` → `multiple-value-bind` — ranked by word-boundary alignment.
- **Per-listener history variables & sticky package.** `*`/`**`/`***`,
  `/`/`//`/`///`, `+`/`++`/`+++` follow standard CL REPL semantics and are kept
  per window (bound with `progv` around evaluation, so concurrent REPLs never
  clobber one another or the global `cl:*`); `(in-package …)` sticks and the
  prompt reflects the current package.
- **Persistent history, transcript, file loading.** Input history is saved to
  `~/.tvlisp_history`; Up/Down recall it, **Ctrl-R** searches it.  File ▸ Load
  file (F7) loads a `.lisp` file with captured output; Save transcript writes the
  buffer; Save/Restore session reopens your REPL windows and their packages.
- **Arglist echo & a live status line.** As you type, the status line shows the
  operator's lambda list (via `sb-introspect`), e.g. `(mapcar function list
  &rest more-lists)`; otherwise it shows the current package, thread count and
  busy state.
- **Presentations.** Every value the REPL prints is a live object, not just
  text: **double-click a result** to open the inspector on the actual object and
  drill into its structure (SLY-style).
- **Live self-modification.** The IDE is itself a Common Lisp image, so you can
  redefine it *from its own REPL* with no rebuild or restart — `handle-event`,
  `draw`, commands, palettes are all ordinary generic functions.  For example,
  a `defmethod handle-event :before` on the application class binds a brand-new
  key (here Alt-G) that fires on the very next keystroke:

  ![Bind a new key live: a defmethod typed at the REPL makes Alt-G pop a dialog instantly](media/repl-live-keybinding.gif)

  ![Double-click a printed REPL result to inspect the live object](media/repl-presentations.gif)

**The debugger (SLIME `sldb`-style, across the worker-thread boundary)**

A signalled error pops an "Error — pick a restart" dialog while the worker stays
parked with its stack live:

- Pick a restart to invoke it on the worker's own stack; **`USE-VALUE` /
  `STORE-VALUE`** prompt for a Lisp form so the computation can *resume* past the
  error, not just unwind.  Abort returns to a fresh prompt.
- **Backtrace** opens a frame browser built for reading.  It **hides
  debugger/runtime machinery** by default (the signalling chain, the evaluator,
  the worker loop), shows the **condition** in its header, and **marks (►) and
  focuses** the frame that *signalled* the error; **`a`** toggles the full stack.
  Each row is a **call form with its arguments** — e.g. `(parse "oops")`, via
  `sb-debug`'s `frame-call` — followed by a **`file:line`** locator.  **`/`** and
  **`n`** search the stack.

  ![Readable backtrace: machinery hidden, condition header, calls with arguments and file:line, `a` reveals the full stack](media/backtrace-readable.gif)

- **Inline locals.** Press Enter on a frame to expand its **local variables**
  (captured live via `sb-di`) right under it; Enter on a local opens the **object
  inspector** on its value, which you can **drill into** (a `TOutline` tree —
  slots, conses, vectors, hash-table entries, arbitrarily deep).

  ![Expanding a frame's locals inline; eval a form in the frame with `x`](media/backtrace-locals.gif)

- **Frame ops** in the backtrace browser:
  - **`r`** *returns from the frame* — unwind the worker's live stack to that
    frame and make it return a value you type (`sb-debug`'s
    `unwind-to-frame-and-call`), so you can step past a bad call without
    restarting the computation.
  - **`c`** *restarts the frame* — unwind to it and re-run it with the same
    arguments (best-effort; arguments can be optimized away).
  - **`v`** *views the source* — jump to the frame's definition in an editor.
  - **`d`** *disassembles* the frame's own (live) function — works for methods,
    closures and anonymous code, not just named functions.
  - **`x`** *evaluates a form in the frame* — with the frame's locals bound.

  ![Returning a value from a frame: the computation resumes past the error](media/debugger-frame-ops.gif)

  ![Restarting a frame: a transient failure succeeds when the frame is re-run](media/backtrace-restart-frame.gif)

  ![Jump to a frame's source with `v`](media/backtrace-goto-source.gif)

**Code-intelligence tools (Lisp menu)**

- **Inspect `*`** (F8) or **Inspect expr…** — a `TOutline` tree of any value;
  Enter (or `i`) on a node drills into that value (re-rooting in place, with a
  breadcrumb), **Backspace** goes back and **`f`** goes forward again, and `g`
  jumps to its definition (for symbols, classes and named functions).

  ![Inspecting a value and drilling into a nested element](media/inspector-drill.gif)

  Inspecting a **symbol** shows its whole namespace — name, home package, value,
  function / macro / special-operator, the class it names, plist and
  documentation — each cell drillable:

  ![Inspecting a symbol: value, plist and documentation as a drillable tree](media/inspect-symbol.gif)
- **Object clipboard** (Window ▸ Object clipboard) — a LispWorks-style place to
  park **live objects** (not text) and move them between tools.  **Clip** the
  REPL's last value (`*`) from the Lisp menu / right-click, or press **`c`** in
  an Inspector to clip the object under inspection (drill in first to clip a
  nested value).  The clipboard window lists each object by type and printed
  value; on a row, **Enter/`i`** re-inspects it, **`d`** removes it, **`p`**
  pastes it back into the REPL as a live `(clip N)` reference that evaluates to
  the very same object, and **`/`** fuzzy-filters the list.  Clipped objects are held by strong references (so they
  stay alive — and pinned against GC — until you remove them).

  ![Object clipboard: clip a live value, inspect it, paste it back as (clip N)](media/object-clipboard.gif)
- **Macroexpand** — an interactive macro stepper (Emacs `macrostep` /
  SLIME-style).  The form is navigable: put the cursor on **any** subform and
  expand *just that macro, in place* (`e`), so the surrounding code stays put and
  reads as ordinary source.  `Tab` jumps to the next expandable position, `m`
  fully expands the subform, `M` expands every macro in the form
  (`sb-cltl2:macroexpand-all`), `u` undoes and `0` resets, and `o`/`c` send the
  result to an editor / the clipboard.

  ![Interactive macro stepper: expand a macro at the cursor in place, Tab to the next, M to expand all](media/macroexpand-step.gif)

  ![Expanding every macro in the form at once with `M` (macroexpand-all)](media/macroexpand-all.gif)

- **Describe**, **Documentation**, **Disassemble** — into scrollable windows.
- **Trace / Untrace** — toggle `trace` on a function (output streams into the
  REPL as it is called); Untrace-all lists and clears the traced set.
- **Call tree** (Lisp ▸ Profile/trace ▸ Call tree) — *watch* functions
  (`sb-int:encapsulate`) so every call/return is recorded with its **live** args
  and result, shown as a depth-indented tree; each row is a presentation (Enter
  inspects the arguments or the result).

  ![Watching a function records a navigable, depth-indented call tree](media/call-tree.gif)

- **Break on entry** (Lisp ▸ Profile/trace) — arm a function so its next call
  stops in the cross-thread debugger (navigable backtrace + frame ops; CONTINUE
  resumes).  `(break)`, `cerror` and `invoke-debugger` route there too.

  ![Break on entry: the next call stops in the debugger; CONTINUE resumes](media/break-on-entry.gif)

- **Cross-reference** (Lisp ▸ Navigate) — who **calls / references / binds / sets
  / macroexpands** a symbol, in one navigable results window (Enter jumps to the
  site, **`/` fuzzy-filters** the hits); plus go-to-definition with an **Alt-,**
  pop-back stack.

  ![Who-sets: find every place a variable is assigned, jump to the source](media/xref-who-sets.gif)
- **Symbol browser** (Apropos) — a modeless, LispWorks-style window with a live
  **Filter** field and a list of matching symbols, each tagged with what it is
  shown in sortable **Package / Symbol / Type** columns (function / macro /
  generic-function / variable / constant / class / package).  Click a header or
  press `s` / `r` to sort; press Enter to (re)load the candidate pool with
  apropos, then **type in the Filter to narrow it live with fuzzy (flex)
  matching** — `outstr` finds `WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING`.  Enter describes the
  focused symbol, `i` inspects it, and the window stays open.

One `FUZZY-FILTER-MIXIN` powers fuzzy filtering everywhere it appears — the
Symbol Browser's live Filter field, every modal picker (window list, Classes,
Packages, …), the `/`-filtered results windows (cross-reference, profiler,
method browser, …) and `/`-pruned trees (class hierarchy, call graph, project
source).  Press **`/`** to start a fuzzy search; it never interferes with other
keys:

![Fuzzy filtering across the IDE: the Symbol Browser, the window-list and Classes/Packages/Systems pickers, the cross-reference and method-browser results windows, and the class-hierarchy tree — all driven by one mixin, started with /](media/fuzzy-tour.gif)
- **Class browser** — a **fuzzy-filtered** list of every class (press **`/`** to
  filter, e.g. `strout` finds `STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM`); OK / Enter jumps to the
  selected class's definition, Inspect opens it in the object inspector.
- **Package browser** — a fuzzy-filtered list (`/` to filter); OK / Enter
  switches the listener's current package, Inspect opens it in the inspector.
- **ASDF System browser** (load on Enter), **Load buffer** (evaluate an editor
  window into the REPL).
- **HyperSpec lookup** — opens the browser on the Common Lisp HyperSpec page
  for the symbol at the cursor (resolved via the HyperSpec's `Map_Sym.txt`);
  prompts, prefilled, when there is no symbol or it is not a standard one.
- **Profiler** — statistical (`sb-sprof`) and deterministic (`sb-profile`).
  Runs on the worker thread so the UI stays live, then shows the results in a
  sortable `TTableView` grid (Self% / Cumul% / Samples / Function — click a
  header or press `s`/`r` to re-sort, **`/` to fuzzy-filter by name**); **Enter**
  jumps to a function's source and **`g`** opens the call-graph as a `TOutline`
  tree (which, like the class-hierarchy and project-source trees, also takes
  **`/`** to prune to matching nodes and their ancestors).

![The tvlisp statistical profiler: sortable results table and call-graph outline](media/profiler.gif)

![The class browser: Goto def jumps to source, Inspect opens the object inspector](media/class-browser.gif)

**Editing & windows**

- **Lisp syntax highlighting** in editor windows — comments, strings, `#\chars`
  and `:keywords` are coloured, and the paren matching the one at the cursor is
  highlighted.  Editor windows use the classic Turbo Vision **blue** background
  (the REPL keeps its input colours).

  ![Classic blue editor with Lisp syntax highlighting and a selection](media/blue-editor.gif)  **Auto-indent** follows Emacs `cl-indent`: per-operator specs
  give each form's distinguished arguments a deeper indent and the body two
  columns, ordinary calls align under their first argument, binding/literal and
  quoted/backquoted lists align under their first element, `loop` clauses align
  under the first clause (a `when`/`if` clause body indents two further), and
  user macros with a `&body` argument are indented like special forms (looked up
  live in the image).  **Tab** re-indents the current line (or the
  selected lines) — or, when the cursor follows a symbol, **completes** it (see
  below); **Alt-Q** re-indents the whole top-level form.  **Undo /
  redo** (Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Y, also on the Edit menu and the right-click context
  menu).
- **Text selection** — drag with the mouse, or hold **Shift** with any
  navigation key (Left/Right, Up/Down, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn, and Ctrl-Left/Right
  by word) to extend the selection; a plain navigation key collapses it.
  **Select all** (Ctrl-A, also on the Edit and context menus).  The selection
  is drawn as a clear reverse-video highlight, and **Cut / Copy / Paste**
  (Ctrl-X/C/V or the Edit / context menus) and typing operate on it.  The
  clipboard is shared, so you can copy in one window and paste into another.

  ![Shift with navigation keys extends the (reverse-video) text selection](media/shift-selection.gif)

  ![Edit ▸ Select all highlights the whole buffer; typing replaces it](media/select-all.gif)

  ![Copy a mouse selection in one window and paste it into another](media/copy-paste.gif)

![Lisp auto-indent and Alt-Q reflow in an editor window](media/auto-indent.gif)

![Lisp syntax highlighting in an editor window](media/syntax-highlight.gif)
- **Eval from an editor** — Lisp ▸ Eval defun (the top-level form at the cursor)
  and Eval region (the selection) submit into a REPL.
- **Compile with navigable notes** (SLIME `C-c C-c`) — Lisp ▸ Compile defun (the
  form at the cursor) or Compile buffer compiles *without loading* and lists the
  compiler warnings/notes in a window; **Enter on a note jumps to the offending
  source** (located precisely by matching the symbol named in the message), and
  **`/` fuzzy-filters** the notes.

  ![Compile the form at point and jump to each compiler note](media/compile-defun-notes.gif)

- **Symbol completion in editor buffers** — **Tab** after a symbol prefix
  completes it against the buffer's package (a popup picker for multiple
  candidates), reusing the REPL's completion backend.

  ![Tab completion and comment toggling in an editor buffer](media/editor-productivity.gif)

- **Comment region** (Edit ▸ Comment region) toggles `;;` over the selected lines
  or the current line.
- **Structural editing** (Edit ▸ Structural) — paredit-style **wrap** the form at
  the cursor in `()`, **splice** (remove the enclosing parens), **raise** (replace
  the enclosing form with the one at point), **transpose** (swap the sexp at point
  with its sibling — works on args and `let` bindings), **slurp / barf** in both
  directions (the form absorbs / expels a sexp at either end), and **kill sexp**
  (delete the form at point).

  ![Slurp pulls the next form in; barf pushes the last form out](media/paredit-slurp-barf.gif)

- **Rename symbol** (Edit ▸ Rename symbol) — whole-token rename across every open
  editor buffer, with a preview of the occurrences and a confirm before applying.
  Defaults to **code only** (skips strings and comments) and consults the running
  image (`who-calls` / `who-references` / `who-binds` / `who-sets`) to warn when
  other, unopened files also reference the symbol.

  ![Rename a symbol across the buffer with a preview and confirm](media/rename-symbol.gif)

- **Reorder args** (Edit ▸ Reorder args) — reads a function's lambda list from the
  running image, asks for a new order of its required parameters (by name or
  1-based index), then rewrites the positional arguments at every direct call site
  in the open buffers, with a preview and confirm.  `apply` / `funcall` / `#'`
  uses and the definition site are left untouched.
- **Insert template** (Edit ▸ Insert template) — `defun` / `defclass` /
  `defmethod` / `loop` / `handler-case` / … skeletons, indented to the cursor.
- **Go-to-definition pop-back** — **Alt-.** jumps to a definition; **Alt-,** pops
  back to where you came from (a navigation stack across jumps).  Source paths
  are resolved even when the binary has been moved away from its sources.

  ![Go to definition jumps to the symbol's source file](media/jump-to-source.gif)
- **Find / Find-next** (Ctrl-F / Ctrl-L) in the focused REPL transcript *or
  editor window*, with **case-sensitive / whole-word / backward** options, plus
  **Replace** — all-at-once or **query-replace** (confirm each match).
  **Incremental search** (type-to-jump, Down for next), **Go to line**, and a
  **word-wrap** toggle round out the editor.

  ![Incremental search in an editor window](media/isearch.gif)

  ![Find and Replace in an editor window](media/find-replace.gif)

  **Right-click context menu**,
  **open a file in an editor window** (a `TEditWindow`) via a
  reusable `TFileDialog` — type a path or browse: Enter on a directory descends
  into it, Enter on `..` goes back up, Enter on a file opens it.
- **Editor gutter** — file editor windows carry a left margin with optional
  **line numbers** (Options ▸ Line numbers; the current line is highlighted) and
  a **git diff** mark on each line added (green bar), changed (yellow bar), or
  deleted (red mark) relative to git `HEAD`.  Signs recompute when the file is
  loaded or saved, and refresh on idle so external git operations (commit,
  checkout, stage) show up too.  Files outside a repository show just the line
  numbers.

  ![Editor gutter: line numbers plus added / changed / deleted git marks](media/git-gutter.gif)
- **Scroll bars on both axes** — the editor, REPL and text windows carry a
  vertical scroll bar on the right and a horizontal one along the bottom (right
  of the editor's position indicator); long unwrapped lines scroll sideways and
  the proportional thumb tracks the view.  The same goes for the **table**,
  **list**, **outline** and **HTML** windows — and the **modal pickers**, whose
  bar sits on the list's bottom edge, above the OK/Cancel buttons, so a long
  window title or class name scrolls into view.  A wide table, long list item or
  deep tree scrolls horizontally, dropping the leftmost column/text and revealing
  the rightmost.

  ![A long line scrolls sideways; the horizontal scroll bar's thumb tracks the view](media/horizontal-scrollbar.gif)

  ![Scrolling a wide table sideways: the Package column slides off as Type comes into view](media/table-hscroll.gif)

  ![Scrolling a list sideways: long method labels slide left to reveal their trailing specializer](media/list-hscroll.gif)

  ![Scrolling a modal picker: a long window-list title slides to reveal the rest, the buttons staying put](media/picker-hscroll.gif)
- **Options:** theme picker (`TColorDialog`), pretty-print toggle, eval-timing
  toggle (`; N ms`), auto-close parens, **line numbers**, and a **DOS mouse
  cursor** — an experimental reverse-video software pointer that follows the
  mouse the way Turbo Vision drew it on text-mode displays (it asks the terminal
  for hover motion via `?1003h`; most modern terminals still draw their own
  arrow on top, which there is no portable way to hide).

  ![Experimental DOS-style software mouse cursor following the pointer](media/dos-mouse.gif)
- **Thread monitor** (F9, Window ▸ Threads) lists the worker threads with
  Refresh / Kill; new REPL (F2), Clear (F3), Tile (F4), Cascade (F5), Next (F6),
  Close (Window ▸ Close), Help (F1).
- **Project manager** (Window ▸ Projects, **Alt-P**) — a persistent, git-aware,
  multi-root file explorer (the IDE "sidebar").  Add any number of project roots
  (**A**, a directory picker); each becomes an expandable tree of its files.
  - **Git-aware file list.** Files come from what **git tracks** (`git ls-files`)
    plus **untracked-but-not-ignored** files (`ls-files --others`), so build
    artifacts and ignored files never appear; a non-git directory falls back to
    every file on disk.  Each file carries an open/closed bullet (● open in an
    editor, ○ not) and a status tag — **`[M]`** modified, **`[+]`** staged,
    **`[?]`** untracked, **`[L]`** loaded into the image — and a matching row
    tint; folders containing changes are tinted too.
  - **Lazy + tidy.** Directories load their children **on first expand**, so the
    tree scales to large repos; directories with `.lisp` files expand by default
    while doc / asset directories stay folded.  **`/`** fuzzy-filters the whole
    tree (auto-expanding matches), and **S** cycles the file sort order
    **name → type → recent**.
  - **Open & evaluate.** **Enter** opens (or focuses) the file in an editor;
    **O** opens every file under a node; **L** loads / **C** compiles-and-loads
    the file into the running image.  **Reveal current file** (Window menu)
    expands the tree to whatever the focused editor is showing.
  - **File operations** (single keys, or a **right-click** context menu):
    **N** new file, **K** new folder, **M** rename, **D** delete (folders
    recursively, with a confirm) — refusing to touch an item that is open in an
    editor, or a project root.
  - **Find in files.** **F** greps the focused root (`git grep`, else
    `grep -rnI`) and lists matches in a fuzzy-filterable picker; choosing one
    jumps to that file and line.
  - **Persistent & live.** Roots **and which folders are expanded** persist to
    `~/.tvlisp_projects`; the window reopens itself on startup, single-instance
    (Alt-P focuses it).  It auto-refreshes on idle, so files created/changed
    outside the IDE (and git state) show up on their own — like the editor's git
    gutter.  **R** removes a root from the list (files on disk untouched), **G**
    rescans now.  (Distinct from File ▸ Open System…, which browses one ASDF
    system's component tree.)

  ![The project manager in action: two repos as roots, git status badges, lazy expand, sort, find-in-files, new file and reveal](media/project-manager.gif)
- **Numbered windows** — each window is assigned the lowest free number 1–9
  (shown in its frame, classic TV style); **Alt-1…9** jumps straight to that
  window.
- **Zoom** (F5) toggles the active window between its size and the full desktop;
  **Size/Move** (Ctrl-F5) enters interactive keyboard move (arrows) / resize
  (Shift+arrows), Enter or Esc to finish.
- **Window list** (Window ▸ List, Alt-0) — a picker of every open window
  (numbered, the active one marked); press **`/`** to fuzzy-filter the list, Enter
  / OK raises and focuses the chosen window, like the classic Turbo Vision IDE's
  Alt-0.  (The same `/`-to-filter mixin powers every modal picker — snippet
  inserter, method / trace / profiler choosers, …)
- **Close** (Window ▸ Close) closes the active window; a modified editor first
  prompts Save / Discard / Cancel so you don't lose unsaved changes — and for a
  never-saved buffer, choosing Save brings up the Save As dialog.

![Window ▸ Close prompts to save; an unsaved buffer gets a Save As dialog](media/close-confirm.gif)

![Window list (Alt-0): pick any open window to raise it](media/window-list.gif)
- **HyperSpec browser** (Help ▸ HyperSpec / browse…) — a `THtmlView` hypertext
  control that renders the simple, CSS/JS-free HTML used by references like the
  Common Lisp HyperSpec.  Tab / Shift-Tab move between links, Enter (or a click)
  follows one, and a Back / Forward history is kept — Ctrl-B (or Backspace) goes
  Back, Ctrl-F goes Forward, Ctrl-R reloads (Alt-←/→ work too where the terminal
  sends them).  Back / Forward (and the history list) restore the scroll position
  you had on each page, so returning to a long document lands where you left off
  — even for `#anchor` jumps within a single page.  `/` searches the page
  (find-in-page) with `n` / `N` to jump
  between highlighted hits.  Help ▸ Browser history pops up the
  visited-page list (current marked) so you can jump straight to any of them.
  Remote pages are fetched with `curl` (no in-image TLS needed); local files
  are read directly.  The Help menu also opens the online SBCL, ECL, and CCL
  manuals in the same browser.

The **Open** dialog has a live type-ahead **Filter** (it narrows the list as you
type and auto-selects the first match, so Enter opens it), a current-directory
**breadcrumb**, and a **Hidden**-files toggle.

**Saving** is a distinct dialog: a **Name** field pre-filled with a suggested
filename, the active file **mask shown as a hint** (`(*.lisp)`), a **New folder**
button, and an **overwrite confirmation** before it replaces an existing file.

## Notes

`asdf:make` dumps a standalone executable; run `make clean` to remove the binary
and this project's fasl cache.

Jump-to-source (go-to-definition, xref, compiler notes) uses the absolute
pathnames SBCL recorded at build time.  If you move the binary away from its
sources, those features still find the files by searching for the trailing path
under the executable's directory, the current directory, and
`tvision-tvlisp::*source-root*` (set it to your source tree to override).

The mouse works throughout: click/drag a scroll bar, double-click a list item,
drag a title bar, drag the bottom-right corner to resize, click `[×]`/`[↑]`, and
the wheel scrolls.  **F10** opens the menu bar (or **Alt+letter**), **Alt-1..9**
select a window, **Alt-X** quits, and **resizing the terminal** reflows the UI.
