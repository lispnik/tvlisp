;;;; threadmon.lisp --- A refreshable thread monitor window.
;;;;
;;;; Lists the live SB-THREAD threads and supports operations on them (kill /
;;;; refresh).  Built on TLIST-BOX; the list owns the snapshot of threads so the
;;;; focused row maps back to a real thread object.  Useful for watching the
;;;; per-listener REPL worker threads (see repl.lisp) and killing a runaway one.

(in-package #:tvision)

;; This file ships with the tvlisp application (not the core tvision library);
;; it extends the TVISION package, so it exports its public symbols here rather
;; than from the library's package.lisp.
